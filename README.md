# Student Marks Capture System

## Prerequisites ##
This project was created in Java in Project SDK version 11.0.2 using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.2.2.

This was the first of three projects as part of the Object Oriented Programming module at the University of Birmingham, implementing the basic concepts of OOP.

## Goal ##
The goal of this project is to create a menu-driven text-based application that can:
  1. generate a student ID based on a student’s full name
  2. capture (record) marks for multiple students
  3. draw a simple bar chart of a student’s highest and lowest marks
  4. print a table of student IDs and corresponding average (mean) mark.

## File Layout ##
* Extract JavaAssign1_Khilan_Kamlesh_2307483.zip and open folder as project in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
* Code design and implementation in Assignment211/src/StudentMarking.java
* Assignment211/testFiles folder includes .txt files to test the functionality and edge case scenarios in IntelliJ after completing a section of code.
* The results of tests are compared against expectedOutput files in the Assignment211/answerFiles folder using IntelliJ's Run/Debug configurations.
* Output of code is copied to file Assignment211/StudentOutput.txt
